## Tasks  
**Objective:** 
- *understand the difference between overload and overriding;*
- *modeling the relationship "can do" by the ICloneable and IEquatable interfaces;*
- *use dependency injection in the method technique;*
- *use correctly of inheritancies;*
- *understand DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself), SoC (Separation of Concerns principles), Low Coupling principles;*
- *write agile extensible testable code;*
- *study design pattern Visitor.*
1. To refactor the algorithm [Task 2 Module 3](https://github.com/EPM-RD-NETLAB/.NET-Framework-modules/tree/master/M3.%20Types) (not to use delegates and standard interfaces), allowing to sorting both in ascending and descending, depending on comparison criterion of the matrix rows. Develop unit-tests using varioгs comparison criterion of the matrix rows.
2. Develop a geometric shapes class hierarchy - Circle, Triangle, Square, Rectangle. Classes should describe the properties of a shape and have methods for calculating the area and perimeter of the shape. (*A task with an emphasis on building an inheritance hierarchy, without unduly detailed implementation*).
3. Create Polynomial class for working with polynomials of degree n > 0 of one real variable (as an internal structure for storing coefficients use the sz-array). Override the necessary methods of the System.Object Type and also overload base operations for working with polynomials. Develop unit-tests.
